            <p>The war took many. Our numbers are coming back. Weʼre not sure how many higher-order sentient beings might exist beyond <a href="/places/#the-cradle">The Cradle</a>.</p>

        <p>The ages of Earth are not typically known or named except in hindsight.</p>
        <p>First Earth was the rise, time, and fall of humans, also known as homo-sapiens (by them) and First Earthers (by us). They gave the planet its name, which we still use to this day.</p>
        <p>Second Earth was the rise of the <a href="/species/#fenghuang">Fenghuang</a> and decline of humans. The Fenghuang are believed to have created <a href="/places/#the-cradle">The Cradle</a> alongside the humans who remained.</p>
        <p>Third Earth was the rise and destruction of Maul, and saw many higher-order species migrate to <a href="/places/#the-cradle">The Cradle</a> in waves. Eventually leading Maul to The Cradle and <a href="/events/#the-battle-over-third-earth">The Battle over Third Earth</a>.</p>
        <p>Fourth Earth is the time following the destruction of Maul.</p>
