4th Earth LoreIntroduction
Previous sentient beings just called this place Earth. Those were what we call First Earthers. They called themselves “humans,” but I’m getting ahead of myself. Each era of Earth is marked by at least one defining moment that fundamentally changes the way higher-order sentient beings occupy this planet; therefore, each era is not of a specific duration and usually doesn’t come to be identified and named until after it’s already started.
Fourth Earth is a bit different because there was no debate that the destruction of Marl, a First Earth sorcerer. Over 500 years ago the Grimalkin destroyed Marl, ushering in the rediscovery and distribution of magic. These events marked the beginning of Fourth Earth.
The rise of the Grimalkin, the feline-like species, was the beginning of Third Earth. The Grimalkin along with the Fenghuang worked to create technology that could match and overtake the magic of Marl.
Second Earth was marked by the descent of humans who left us primarily with the Credit System and Citizen Goggles. It’s believed the Fenghuang were the first higher-order sentient species to rise either directly after humans or with minor overlap. With humans gone, it didn’t take long for a diverse population of sentient beings to rise. It’s believed most came from domesticated animals. However, there is no proof and no real reward in speculation given domestication was thousands of years ago and the Fenghuang trace their history for almost 4,000 years. We do know the Credit System and Citizen Goggles have existed in one form or another since First Earth.
Fourth Earth has eight continents. Each continent is dominated by one of the eight primary habitats. Each habitat is believed to be the origin of the seven higher-order species. While it is very anthropocentric, but it’s how we try and answer that fundamental question of: Where did I come from?
We all agree it’s probably not true. We also all agree it’s pointless to do much more than speculate on the matter.
But I digress.
Dragonus is the tundra or ice continent. It is the supposed origin of the Fenghuang. I say “supposed” because Fourth Earth is integrate and diverse. So, all species live on all continents. With that said, each continent tends to be dominated naturally by the species predisposed to that habitat.Continents

Species
First Earth marked the fall of the human species and rise of the Fenghuang. We believe the other seven sentient species were not far behind; however, they were separated by great distance for the duration of Second Earth. Third Earth saw the rise of the tyrannical sorcerer, Marl; so many were lost during Third Earth.
We have only started to recover the populations lost.
With one last ditch effort, made primarily of Grimalkin, leveraging Fenghuang technology ushered in Fourth Earth and are believed to have destroyed Marl.
The majority of sentient beings now live in the same area, spanning just over 12 miles in diameter in a temperate zone we call, The Cradle (Islamabad region).
Having seen the benefit in working together, all sentient beings on the planet know that, if they need to retreat again, they are always welcome.
Each of the eight higher-order sentient beings is believed to have evolved from the creatures of previous eras. This evolution seems to only effect physical appearance and any innate characteristics of the original species have been lost to the sands of evolution. The species are the:
Capra
Chiroptera
Caudata
Grampus
Cigwe
Hundkin
Grimalkin
Fenghuang
Fenghuang
The Fenghuang are believed to have descended from flightless birds on the continent of Dragonus. Aquiline nose. Round eyes, round pupil, barely visible sclera. The slightly pronounced eyebrow exaggerates the backward slow of the forehead. Hair is the texture of bristle and down feathers, with interlocking barbs creating sheets and layers; only present on the head. No external, protruding ears; similar to the Caudata, Grampus, and Cigwe.
The Fenghuang build The Central Habitat of The Cradle; the other habitats were not built until The Great Grimalkin Immigration. 
The Fenghuang had contact with the remaining First Earthers before their extinction.
Grimalkin
The Grimalkin are believed to have descended from felines on the continent of Mau. Narrow nasal passages and bridge-less nose. Human shaped eyes, visible sclera, vertical slit pupil. Canine teeth similar to the Hundkin, though more narrow. Typically lithe skeletal structure compared to other species. Almond-shaped eyes.
The Grimalkin joined The Cradle at the beginning of Third Earth. They were the first to experience Marl and came with their surviving population and a plan. It was a long-term, strategic plan. It seems to have worked. While the Fenghuang designed The Cradle and the technology used, the Grimalkin provided the manpower and training to prepare for the onslaught of Marl.
Hundkin
The Hundkin are believed to have descended from canines on the continent of Sobaka. Nose similar to the Grimalkin. Human shaped eyes, visible sclera, round pupil. Enlarged canine teeth. Generally “hearty” in build and musculature.
The Hundkin were the last to come to The Cradle; arriving at The Battle of Third Earth, acting as an unplanned and welcomed flank attack. They never experienced Marl directly. 
Cigwe
The Cigwe are believed to have descended from predator birds on the continent of Halgai. Nose similar to the Fenghuang, only broader. Round eyes, no sclera, round pupil. Slightly overdeveloped chest with legs similar to the Fenghuang.
The Cigwe joined The Cradle in the middle of Second Earth with The Cigwe Immigration.
Grampus
The Grampus are believed to have descended from porpoises on the continent of Oceana. Broad, flat nose. Round eyes, with no visible pupils or sclera. Broad upper body, tapering into narrow lower body.
The Grampus joined The Cradle in the early-middle of Third Earth with The Grampus Immigration. 
Caudata
The Caudata are believed to have descended from salamanders on the continent of Walumban. Narrow nose, with little protrusion. Round eyes, no visible pupils or sclera. Long torso, “beanpole.”
The Caudata joined The Cradle in the middle of Third Earth following the Grampus with The Caudata Immigration.
Chiroptera
The Chiroptera are believed to have descended from bats on the continent of Sotz. Narrow nose, with little protrusion; similar to Caudata. Round eyes, no visible pupils or sclera. Long, narrow fingers. Body shape similar to Grampus.
The Chiroptera joined The Cradle in the late-middle of Third Earth following the Caudata with The Chiroptera Immigration.
Capra
The Capra are believed to have descended from goats on the continent of Geit. Wide nostrils running the full length of the nose, flat and broad, no eyebrow ridge. Teardrop-shaped eyes, no visible sclera, horizontal slit pupil. Diamond shaped, external ears. Horns are short ranging from unexposed protrusions beneath the skin and short exposed horns.
The Capra joined The Cradle just before The Battle of Third Earth following the Chiroptera and were followed by Marl to find The Cradle.Tools and Technology
Citizen Goggles
A pair of Citizen Goggles are issued to every higher-order sentient being when they reach 25 revolutions.
Citizen Goggles allow for both augmented and virtual reality simulation and interaction. The standard issue goggles are required to be worn at all times inside The Cradle.
The standard issue goggles are made of a single sheet of Biofabricated Glass framed in Biofabricated Aluminum. The lens is designed to be hidden from view of the wearer as much as possible; extending from one temple to the other and from above the eyebrows to below the cheekbones. A 50 millimeter wide, adjustable strap made of Biofabricated Cloth secures the device the wearer. Bone conduction speakers are attached to the strap and can also be adjusted.
Last Ditch allows its citizens to choose an alternative pair goggles made from a modified pair of the standard issue goggles; they’re more glasses than goggles to allow easy removal and storage. The lens is reduced in height while maintaining the wraparound width. The frame is repurposed to create a larger top frame and temple arms. The strap is shortened and attached to the ends of the temple arms; adjustable for a secure fit and can be removed.
Citizen Goggles facilitate augmented and virtual reality experiences. They are the primary communication and transaction technology of Fourth Earth.
Citizen Cane
A Citizen Cane is issued to every higher-order sentient being when they reach 25 revolutions. At this age the height of the individual is typically static. This is important as the length of each cane is determined by the height of the individual. The length of the fully assembled cane is equal to the height of the individual. 
Most of the length of the cane is 25 millimeters in diameter. The cane’s main shaft is made of Biofabricated Steel. One end of the cane is tapered to a point (referred to as the spear) while the opposite end has a wide ring surrounding the shaft (referred to as the cudgel). Both the spear tip and the cudgel ring are made of Biofabricated Tungsten to add weight and balance.
The cane can be separated at the middle by unscrewing the two ends from one another. Once separated the individual can wield the spear in one hand and the cudgel in the other.
The spear and cudgel are able to split at the middle as well in the same manner as breaking the cane down into the spear and the cudgel. However, the two parts that make up the spear and cudgel are connected by a narrow chain of Biofabricated Steel. Typically the cane is broken down in this manner for easier storage and carrying; usually in clothing pockets or accessories on the outside of the thigh, base of the spine, or similar.
The design was inspired by the primary tool of the Grimalkin and modified using Fenghuang materials.

A form of primate. Bipedal locomotion. Large complex brains allowed them to develop advanced tools, culture, and language.Second Earth
The Fenghuang discover they aren’t the only higher order sentient beings on the planet due to The Cigwe Immigration.
The Cigwe ImmigrationThird Earth
Marked by Marl, the sorcerer and a mass immigration of Grimalkin to The Cradle. Prior to this immigration and welcoming of the Grimalkin by the Fenghuang word of other higher-order sentient beings was interpreted as rumor and speculation.
