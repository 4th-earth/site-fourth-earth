With humans gone, it didn’t take long for a diverse population of sentient beings to rise. It’s believed most came from domesticated animals. However, there is no proof and no real reward in speculation given domestication was thousands of years ago and the Fenghuang trace their history for almost 4,000 years.

Fourth Earth has eight continents. Each continent is dominated by one of the eight primary habitats. Each habitat is believed to be the origin of the seven higher-order species. While it is very anthropocentric, but it’s how we try and answer that fundamental question of: Where did I come from?

We all agree it’s probably not true. We also all agree it’s pointless to do much more than speculate on the matter.

Each of the eight higher-order sentient beings is believed to have evolved from the creatures of previous ages. This evolution seems to only effect physical appearance and any innate characteristics of the original species have been lost to the sands of time.

## Fenghuang

**Presumed origin:** [Dragonus](/places/dragonus/)

**Pronounced:** fong-hwah

**Average lifespan:** 200

**Believed to evolve from:** Flightless birds

Believed to be the first higher-order sentient beings to rise as they seemed to have the most overlap with humans.

Aquiline nose. Round eyes, round pupil, barely visible sclera. The slightly pronounced eyebrow exaggerates the backward slope of the forehead. Hair is the texture of bristle and down feathers, with interlocking barbs creating sheets and layers; only present on the head. No external, protruding ears; similar to the [Caudata](#caudata), [Grampus](#grampus), and [Cigwe](#cigwe).

The Fenghuang built The Central Habitat of [The Cradle](/places/#the-cradle); the other habitats were not built until [The Great Grimalkin Immigration](/#the-great-grimalkin-immigration).

The Fenghuang had contact with the remaining First Earthers before their extinction.

## Grimalkin

**Presumed origin:** Mau

**Pronounced:** gri-maul-kin

**Believed to evolve from:** Felines

Narrow nasal passages and bridge-less nose. Human shaped eyes, visible sclera, vertical slit pupil. Canine teeth similar to the [Hundkin](#hundkin), though more narrow. Typically lithe skeletal structure compared to other species. Almond-shaped eyes.

The Grimalkin joined The Cradle at the beginning of Third Earth. They were the first to experience Marl and came with their surviving population and a plan. It was a long-term, strategic plan. It seems to have worked. While the Fenghuang designed The Cradle and the technology used, the Grimalkin provided the manpower and training to prepare for the onslaught of Marl.

## Hundkin

**Presumed origin:** Sobaka

**Pronounced:** hūn-d-kin

**Believed to evolve from:** Canines

Nose similar to the [Grimalkin](#grimalkin). Human shaped eyes, visible sclera, round pupil. Enlarged canine teeth. Generally “hearty” in build and musculature.

The Hundkin were the last to come to The Cradle; arriving at [The Battle of Third Earth](/#the-battle-of-third-earth), acting as an unplanned and welcomed flank attack. They never experienced Marl directly.

## Macropod

**Presumed origin:** Minawara

**Pronounced:** mack-row-pod

**Believed to evolve from:** Marsupials

Broad, flat nose. Round eyes, visible pupils with black sclera. Broad upper body, narrow waist, large thighs.

## Lepus

**Presumed origin:** Oceana

**Pronounced:** lee-pes (as in pest)

**Believed to evolve from:** Hares

Broad, flat nose. Round eyes, visible pupils with black sclera. Narrow upper body, tapering into wide lower body.

The Lepus joined The Cradle in the early-middle of Third Earth with [The Lepus Immigration](/#the-grampus-immigration).

## Caudata

**Presumed origin:** Walumban

**Pronounced:** cah-dah-tah 

**Believed to evolve from:** Salammanders

Narrow nose, with little protrusion. Round eyes, no visible pupils or sclera. Long torso, “beanpole.”
The Caudata joined The Cradle in the middle of Third Earth following the Grampus with [The Caudata Immigration](/#the-caudata-immigration).

## Chiroptera

**Presumed origin:** Sotz

**Pronounced:** Kī-rop-ter-uh

**Believed to evolve from:** Bats

Narrow nose, with little protrusion; similar to [Caudata](#caudata). Round eyes, no visible pupils or sclera. Long, narrow fingers. Body shape similar to [Grampus](#grampus).

The Chiroptera joined The Cradle in the late-middle of Third Earth following the Caudata with [The Chiroptera Immigration](/#the-chiroptera-immigration).

## Capra

**Presumed origin:** Geit

**Pronounced:** cap-ruh 

**Believed to evolve from:** Goats

Wide nostrils running the full length of the nose, flat and broad, no eyebrow ridge. Teardrop-shaped eyes, no visible sclera, horizontal slit pupil. Diamond shaped, external ears. Horns are short ranging from unexposed protrusions beneath the skin and short exposed horns.

The Capra joined The Cradle just before The Battle of Third Earth following the [Chiroptera](#chiroptera), known as [The Capra Immigration](/#the-capra-immigration) and were followed by Marl to find The Cradle.
