# People

People are the name given to all members of the so-called higher-order species of 4th Earth. It’s believed most species came from domesticated animals. However, there is no proof and no reward in speculation, given domestication was thousands of years ago. While we tend to be anthropocentric, it’s how we try to answer the question: Where did I come from?

## Fenghuang

**Pronounced:** fung-HWAHNG

**Average lifespan:** 200

**Believed to evolve from:** Flightless birds

**Physical characteristics:**
    
- Aquiline nose.
- Round eyes, round pupil, barely visible sclera; set more front of face. 
- Hair has the texture of bristle and down feathers, with interlocking barbs creating sheets and layers; only present on the head.
- No external protruding ears.

Believed to be the first higher-order sentient beings to rise, as they had the most overlap and interactions with humans before humans went extinct.

The Fenghuang helped humans build the Central Habitat of [The Cradle](/places/#the-cradle).

## Grimalkin

**Pronounced:** gri-maul-kin

**Believed to evolve from:** Felines

**Physical characteristics:**

- Nose is wider at the forehead junction than at the nostrils; roughly one-third. 
- The eyes are rhomboid, with curves at the nose-forehead junction and the opposite corner, with a visible sclera and a vertical slit pupil; set more front of the face. 
- Hair is short because of the growth and shed cycles.
- Ears taper and are on top of the skull.
- Canine teeth are longer than average and narrow. 

The Grimalkin joined The Cradle at the beginning of Third Earth. They were the first to experience Maul (măll) and came with their surviving population and a plan.

While the Fenghuang, along with the last of the humans, designed The Cradle and some of the technology used, the Grimalkin provided the personnel and training to prepare for war.

## Hundkin

**Pronounced:** hūnd-kin

**Believed to evolve from:** Canines

**Physical characteristics:**

- Nose is wider at the forehead junction than at the nostrils; roughly two-thirds. 
- The eyes are rhomboid, with curves at the nose-forehead junction and the opposite corner, with a visible sclera and round pupil; set more front of face. 
- Hair is short because of the growth and shed cycles.
- Ears taper and are on top of the skull.
- Canine teeth are longer than average and wide.

The Hundkin were the last to come to The Cradle; arriving at [The Battle over Third Earth](/#the-battle-of-third-earth), acting as an unplanned and welcomed flank attack. They never experienced Maul directly.

## Lepus

**Pronounced:** lee-pes (as in pest)

**Believed to evolve from:** Hares

**Physical characteristics:**

- Nose is wider at the forehead junction than at the nostrils; roughly two-thirds. 
- The eyes are circular, with visible pupils and black sclera set more side of the face. 
- Hair is short because of the growth and shed cycles.
- Ears are long, elliptical, and on top of the skull.
- Upper and lower incisors are longer than average.

## Capra

**Pronounced:** cap-ruh 

**Believed to evolve from:** Goats

**Physical characteristics:**

- Nose is wider at the forehead junction than at the nostrils; roughly two-thirds, and no eyebrow ridge. 
- The eyes are rhomboid, with curves at the nose-forehead junction and the opposite corner, no visible sclera, and a horizontal slit pupil; set more side of face. 
- Hair is short because of the growth and shed cycles.
- Ears are long, varied shapes, and on the sides of the skull; often extending horizontally.
- Possible bumps or short horns protrude from the top of the skull.

## Chiroptera

- Hair is short because of the growth and shed cycles.
- Ears are long, varied shapes, and on the sides of the skull; often extending vertically.

## Coati

**Believed to evolve from:** Raccoons

**Physical characteristics:**

- Nose is wider at the forehead junction than at the nostrils; roughly one-third, and minor eyebrow ridge. 
- The eyes are round, with no visible sclera or pupils; set front of face. 
- Hair is short because of the growth and shed cycles.
