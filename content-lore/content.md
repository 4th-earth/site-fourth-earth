# 4th Earth Lore

Each age of the Earth has been marked by the rise or fall of something. These ages are not typically known or named except in hindsight.

What we call First Earth was the rise and time of humans as the dominant sentient beings on this planet. They're the ones who gave the planet its name and we decided not to change it. They're the ones who create the Citizen Goggles and the Gravity Plates. They always believed they would go out with a "bang." Some great war or struggle. In the end, that was not the case.

We mark Second Earth as the point where the human populations were shrinking and new sentient beings were rising.

We mark Third Earth as a dark time. An evil sorcerer made us realize that magic was real, harnessed by gems. The rise of the *felines* and *canines* was at this time. The *Great Migration* saw many of the higher order sentient beings converging on what we now call *The Cradle*. The battle was long fought and hard won but we prevailed; destroying the sorcerer and their disciples.

The fall of the evil sorcerer marks the beginning of Fourth Earth.
