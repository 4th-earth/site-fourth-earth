 This project contains all the content and site code related to [4th Earth](https://4th.earth) Rules as Written and Lore.

 With each site I create I tend to give myself a challenge to help maintain interest. With this one, I've decided on a couple of challenges:

 1. Make it easy for others to contribute.
 2. As an extension of the first, I'm going to keep it as old-school PHP as possible.
 3. Let the server be the server.

 This is a departure from my previous work of removing HTML from the PHP code.
