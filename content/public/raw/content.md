# Rules as Written

These are the rules as written for 4th Earth a [.table-top role playing game](TTRPG). 4th Earth is designed for collaborative storytelling (and home brewing) from the mundane, theatre of the absurd, to the fanciful and super-heroic. Whether you're solo-adventuring or in a group 4th Earth gives you a set of simple mechanics to keep the mystery and unknown alive.

4th Earth uses three primary tools to facilitate the mechanics of play:

1. Life Batteries, 
2. Proficiency Ranks, and 
3. Dice Pools.

Characters have Life Batteries and Proficiencies. Characters *and* Tools have Proficiency Ranks. And Players use both to build Dice Pools, which are rolled in order to perform various actions within a Setting consisting of a Difficulty Rank.

## Core activities

The following activities are core to the 4th Earth gameplay experience.

1. Tracking the value of one or more life batteries.
2. Tracking proficiency points within Proficiency Ranks.
3. Track the number of ranks for a given Proficiency.
4. Generate random numbers between 1 and 12. (Dice are not specifically required, however, 4th Earth RAW uses the language of dice for common reference.)

## Values

1. **Additive over reductive.** Players should be able to start from a simple foundation and add to it, instead of starting from an "everything and the kitchen sink" place and reducing.
2. **Narrative over simulation.** Players should be able to focus on creating engaging stories without strictly replicating reality.
3. **Flow over grinding.** Players should be able to get lost in their story and actions without performing repetitive tasks.
4. **Power ceilings over threat escalation.** Saved the town, saved the country, saved the world, saved the universe, what next? 
5. **Progressive disclosure over saturation.** Players should be able to start playing having never read the rules or specification and learn as they go.

## Setting

4th Earth RAW is a game engine and does not require a specific setting. Further, you can use 4th Earth RAW in the setting of other games.

### Guidance

1. MAY be developed by the players, a narrator, the outside world, or anything else.
2. MUST be agreed to by all players (including the narrator).
3. MUST be enough to give flavor and direction; could be a single sentence or tome. 
4. MUST describe where, when, what, and general theme.
5. MAY include a specific, short-term plot (adventures and one-shots). MAY be a generic, long-term campaign. MAY be a world open for exploration with not agenda beyond exploration. Or, a combination.

### Examples



## Characters

Characters are anything within a Setting that can be personified by a Player.
