# 4th Earth RAW: Sprinkles

4th Earth RAW: Sprinkles are individual mechanics that MAY be sprinkled on top of 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla or your own 4th Earth RAW variation.

*Note: Sprinkles add complexity to gameplay.*

## Allies

- An active ally MUST be a Character who has the ability to perform Actions during a round and those Actions will be in support of the Protagonist or Antagonist, not both.
- If the Antagonist has active allies, the Difficulty Rating MUST be increased by 1 for every 2 active allies. (1 active ally MUST NOT result in an increase, 4 active allies SHOULD result in an increase of 2.)
	- If the Protagonist has active allies, the Difficulty Rating MAY be reduced in the same way as it is increased for the Antagonist. (Both have 2 active allies, Difficulty Rating MAY NOT change based on allies.)

## Resistance

Resistance results in a modification to Protagonist Potential Energy (PE) when attacked in a way that causes physical damage; draining the health Life Battery.

Every Character SHOULD have some type of flesh with varying degrees of thickness.

|Thickness |Resistance |PE adjustment |
|:---------|:---------:|:-------------|
|Thin      |negative 1 |plus 1        |
|Average   |0          |0             |
|Thick     |1          |minus 1       |

Characters MAY have some type of armor.

|Grade  |Resistance |PE adjustment |
|:------|:---------:|:-------------|
|None   |0          |0             |
|Light  |1          |minus 1       |
|Medium |2          |minus 2       |
|Heavy  |3          |minus 3       |

Players MAY apply different modifications for specific areas of the Character (being hit where a Character isn't armored, for example).

## Scale

Scale is a way of measuring the size difference between Characters in a Setting or Scene.

- The smallest Character in a Setting or interaction SHOULD be given a Scale of 1; the Scale of other Characters is relative to 1 in whole number increments.
	- When characters are interacting, the smallest Character in the interaction SHOULD be given a Scale of 1.
	- If the interacting Characters are roughly the same size, both SHOULD be Scale 1.
- Scales MUST be in whole numbers; if a character is not twice or half the size of another, they are all scale 1.

### Antagonist Difficulty Rating: Scale

Imagine a human trying to hit a fly. The human is hundreds of times larger than the fly. The fly is very difficult to hit without tools and being sneaky.

- If the Antagonist is lesser Scale, the Difficulty Rating SHOULD be increased by 1 for each step smaller.

### Resistance: Scale

Presumes Resistance Sprinkle or similar implementation.

Imagine a fly hitting a human. The human is hundreds of times larger than the fly. The human will most likely not take damage enough to matter, even if bitten by the fly.

- We RECOMMEND using in conjunction with the Resistance Sprinkle.
- Larger Scale Characters SHOULD have a higher Resistance, if applicable. We RECOMMEND increasing Resistance by 1 for each step greater the Antagonist is.

## Stance

Stance affords Characters to be more or less aggressive, at a cost.

- Characters MUST be neutral in stance unless announced otherwise.
	- Players MAY decide whether the announcement should be with every Character Action, only if the Stance changes, or, in some other way.
- Changing stance MUST be considered a Fast Action.

### Antagonist Difficulty Rating: Stance

- Difficulty Rating adjustments SHOULD take the Stance of the Protagonist and Antagonist into consideration.
- If the Protagonist and Antagonist are in neutral Stance, there MUST NOT be an adjustment to the Antagonist Difficulty Rating.
	- If the Protagonist is in an offensive Stance and the Antagonist is in a defensive Stance, there MUST NOT be an adjustment.
	- If the Protagonist is in a defensive Stance and the Antagonist is in an offensive Stance, there MUST NOT be an adjustment.
- If the Protagonist and Antagonist are both in an offensive Stance, the antagonist Difficulty Rating SHOULD be decreased by 2.
	- If the protagonist and antagonist are both in a defensive Stance, the Antagonist Difficulty Rating SHOULD be increased by 2.
- If the Protagonist is in an offensive Stance and the Antagonist is in a neutral Stance, the Antagonist Difficulty Rating SHOULD be decreased by 1.
	- If the Protagonist is in a defensive Stance and the Antagonist is in a neutral Stance, the Antagonist Difficulty Rating SHOULD be increased by 1.

|             |P: Offensive |P: Neutral |P: Defensive |
|-------------|:------------|:----------|:------------|
|A: Offensive |Minus 2      |Minus 1    | 0           |
|A: Neutral   |Minus 1      | 0         |Plus 1       |
|A: Defensive |0            |Plus 1     |Plus 2       |

## Re-roll

- Players MAY spend Proficiency Points and non-health Life Battery Points to re-roll an action.
    - When using non-health Life Battery Points, the Points SHOULD use the Target Action Battery. (Any inter-battery recharging mechanics SHOULD apply.)
- Players MAY spend 1 Point to re-roll the whole Dice Pool or 2 Points to re-roll a single die in the pool (including modifier dice, such as a Criticality Die).
- As long as the Character has Points remaining, the Player MAY continue spending Points to re-roll.

## Advanced Technology and Magic

The following mechanics MAY be applied to both advanced technology Tools and magic.

- The use of advanced technology Tools and magic MUST use two rolls and Dice Pools.
	- The first Difficulty Rating MUST represent the difficulty of using the advanced technology or casting a spell.
	- The second Difficulty Rating SHOULD use the Antagonist Difficulty Rating mechanic.
- If the Difficulty Rating of using the tools or casting the spell exceeds 7, the Difficulty Rating SHOULD be set at 7.
- Difficulty Rating to use MUST start at 0 and SHOULD be adjusted using the tables below.
	- Initial Difficulty Rating SHOULD be greater than 0 and MUST NOT be less than 0.
	- We RECOMMEND using all the tables, however, Players MAY pick and choose, or, build their own.
		- The tables used SHOULD remain consistent for an entire session.
- Players SHOULD specify whether Items, Tools, and similar are considered advanaced technology and magic.

### Rarity of Tool or Spell

|Rarity     |Modification |
|:----------|:-----------:|
|Ubiquitous |0            |
|Common     |Plus 1       |
|Uncommon   |Plus 2       |
|Rare       |Plus 3       |

### Target of Tool or Spell

|Target           |Modification |
|:----------------|:-----------:|
|Inanimate object |Plus 1       |
|Self             |Plus 2       |
|Another          |Plus 3       |

### Intent of Protagonist

|Intent   |Modification |
|:--------|:-----------:|
|Survival |0            |
|Heal     |Plus 1       |
|Harm     |Plus 2       |

### Distance from Protagonist

|Distance |Modification |
|:--------|:-----------:|
|Touch    |0            |
|Distance |Plus 1       |
|Ranged   |Plus 2       |

### Internal or External to Target

Some advanced technology or magic MAY move from the Protagonist to the target (external) while others may start *within* the target (internal).

- External technology and magic SHOULD be impacted by Resistance, if applicable.

|Attribute |Modification                                             |
|:---------|:-------------------------------------------------------:|
|Internal  |0                                                        |
|External  |Antagonist Difficulty Rating divided by 4; rounded down. |

## Opposing Difficulty Rating

This Sprinkle is designed to aid in solo-adventuring (the Player is not rolling *for* another Character), introduce opposing rolls (Players can go "head-to-head" with rolls), or both.

- If using opposing rolls between two Players, two Actions MUST be created; one for the the Protagonist and one for the Antagonist.
	- The Initial Difficulty Rating SHOULD be for the Protagonist based on their Action against the Antagonist (see Antagonist Difficulty Rating from 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla).
	- The Difficulty Rating for the Antagonist SHOULD be an opposing Difficulty Rating (see opposing value in the Difficulty Rating Table from 4th Earth RAW).
	- Both Players MAY reduce their Difficulty Ratings as if their Character was performing the Action.
		- The Player with the most ones rolled from their pool SHOULD win.
		- We RECOMMEND ties go to the Protagonist.
- If using opposing rolls to facilitate solo-adventuring, one Action MUST be created and SHOULD use the Difficulty Rating Table from 4th Earth RAW to determine Difficulty Rating for the Player.
	- The non-Player Character (when they are the Protagonist) MUST reduce the Antagonist Difficulty Rating to 0, if possible.
		- If the non-Player Character cannot reduce the Antagonist Difficulty Rating to 0, they MUST reduce it as much as possible.
- If using Criticality, resolution SHOULD be handled as if the non-Player Character was a Player Character and the Protagonist in the exchange.

## Criticality

Criticality represents success *and* failure beyond the intention of the Character for mundane and aggressive actions.

- Characters MUST have one or more non-health Life Batteries.
- Players MUST add an extra die to the Dice Pool, which is known as the Criticality Die and SHOULD be distinct from other dice in the pool; we RECOMMEND using a die with the same number of sides or greater.
	- The die MAY be changed per Session or Action.
- If a 1 is rolled on the Criticality Die, the result is a critical success or failure based on the success or failure of the rest of the Dice Pool, respectively.
- Players MAY decide to opt-out or -in to using the Criticality Die prior to the creation of the Dice Pool.
	- Players SHOULD decide whether they will apply the Critically Die prior to becoming aware of the Difficulty Rating assigned to the Action.
	- Players MAY decide to always roll a Criticality Die as a group decision (part of the Social Contract). We RECOMMEND the decision be made prior to the beginning of the Session.

Beyond the narrative implications and outcomes, Criticality comes with mechanical impacts on the Character.

### Critical, mundane success

A critical success on a non-combat (mundane) action, results in the following changes to the Target Action Battery.

- MUST NOT be the health Battery.

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value   |Affect on Target Action Battery |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------|
|Even number |Plus 1                          |
|1, 5, or 9  |Plus 2                          |
|3 or 7      |Plus 3                          |
|11          |Plus 5                          |

If the Target Action Battery becomes full, the Player MAY distribute the remaining points to other non-health Batteries.

### Critical, mundane failure

Critical, mundane failure is the opposite of a Critical, mundane success.

- MUST subtract the affect in the Critical, mundane success table.
- If the Target Action Battery reaches 0, the Player MUST spend the remaining points against other non-health Batteries.
	- Players SHOULD NOT use other Life Batteries to recharge the Target Action Battery as part of the resolution of Critical, mundane failure.

### Critical, aggressive action success

This implementation presumes 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla. Players MAY replace Potential Energy with the label they use to calculate a draining affect on the health battery (damage).

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value   |Effect                                                                                                              |
|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Even number |Plus 1 to Protagonist Target Action Battery, or, any other non-health Battery if the Target Action Battery is full. |
|1, 5, or 9  |Multiply base Potential Energy by 1.5; MUST be rounded up or down.                                                  |
|3 or 7      |Multiply base Potential Energy by 2.                                                                                |
|11          |Trauma: Roll another 12-sided die and apply result from the Critical, combat success effects extension table        |

#### Critical, combat success effects extension table

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value  |Effect |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|1          |Antagonist Difficulty Rating reduced by 2, Recurring and Compounding                                  |
|2, 5, or 8 |Multiply base Potential Energy by 2, target Antagonist.                                               |
|3, 6, or 9 |Multiply base Potential Energy by 2.5, target Antagonist; MUST be rounded up or down.                 |
|4 or 7     |Reduce Antagonist's spirit Battery by 1; use health Battery if Spirit battery is unavailable or at 0. |
|10         |Reduce Antagonist’s health Battery by 1, Recurring and Compounding.                                   |
|11         |Multiply base Potential Energy by 3, target Antagonist.                                               |
|12         |Antagonist can’t act for 2 rounds; no longer considered an Active Character.                          |

*A note on Recurring and Compounding: A Protagonist is fighting an Antagonist with a Difficulty Rating 6; based on Proficiency Ranks in the Protagonist's Action. The Player rolls a Critical, success resulting in the Difficulty Rating being reduced by 2, becoming a Difficulty Rating 4. Every following round, the Antagonist’s Difficulty Rating will be 4 (Recurring). If the Player manages to roll the same Critical, combat success a second time, the Antagonist’s Difficulty Rating becomes 2 (compounding). This could increase to the point where the Antagonist’s Difficulty Rating becomes 0.*

### Critical, combat failure

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value   |Effect                                                                                                                   |
|:-----------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Even number |Minus 1 from Protagonist's Target Action Battery, or, any other non-health battery, if the Target Action Battery is at 0 |
|1, 5, or 9  |Minus 2 from Protagonist's Target Action Battery, does not impact other Life Batteries, if Target Action Battery is at 0 |
|3 or 7      |Protagonist damages self at one-to-one Scale, 0 resistance, Potential Energy divided by 2 (round down); damage MUST be greater than 0. |
|11          |Trauma: Roll another 12-sided die and apply result from the Critical, combat failure effects extension table             |

#### Critical, combat failure effects extension table

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value |Effect                                                                                                                            |
|:---------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|11        |Tool used is rendered useless for future Rounds. If no Tool is used, multiply Potential Energy by 3, target the Protagonist. |
|Other     |Apply Critical, combat success effects extension table replacing the word “Antagonist” with “Protagonist.”                             |














## Partials and Complications

This modification is designed to operate with the Criticality modification above, however, players MAY choose to use it as a standalone modification.

- Players MUST add an extra die to the Dice Pool, which is known as the Criticality die and SHOULD be distinct from the other dice in the pool; we RECOMMEND a 10-sided die, which represents a 10 percent chance of a partial or complication.
	- The die MAY be changed per session or per action.
- If the greatest number on the Criticality Die is rolled, the result is a partial or complication based on the success or failure of the rest of the Dice Pool.
	- A partial is a mildly positive effect on an otherwise failed action.
	- A complication is a mildly negative effect on an otherwise successful action.
- Players MAY decide to opt-out or -in to using the Criticality Die prior to the creation of the Dice Pool; Players SHOULD decide prior to becoming aware of the difficulty level assigned to the action.
	- Players MAY decide to always roll a Criticality Die as a group decision. We RECOMMEND the decision be made prior to the beginning of the session.

## Assisting other Characters

When assisting other Characters using this modification, one Character transfers one or more of their battery points to the Character performing a given action. The Difficulty Rating here is applied to the action of assisting itself for the assisting character.

- The transfer MUST be from the same battery the point will be transferred to.
- Players MAY transfer battery points from a Character they control to another Character in the Setting; the baseline Difficulty Rating is based on distance between Characters:
	- Touch: Difficulty 0.
	- Distance (usually line of sight): Difficulty 1.
	- Ranged (MAY be out of sight): Difficulty 2.
- Players MAY increase the Difficulty Rating after starting with the baseline.
- The Difficulty Rating to assist SHOULD be less than the initial Difficult Rating of the action being performed by the other Character.
- Assisting SHOULD NOT require movement by the assisting character.

## Death, resurrection, and reincarnation

- If a Character dies, 1 proficiency point SHOULD be removed from all completed Proficiency Ranks. This represents relearning or recovering skills, however, maintaining some memory of the skill.
- If a Character is resurrected, the health battery MUST be set to 1; all other batteries MUST be set to 0.
	- The Character is the same character and MAY retain possessions.
	- *Note: The Character has to have died first, therefore, the impact of death applies.*
- If a Character is reincarnated they are considered to have died and been resurrected, therefore, the impacts of those two situations apply along with:
	- 1 point being removed from all partially acquired Proficiency Ranks.
	- The Character loses all physical possessions they had at the time of death.
	- The Character, if maintained as the actual same Character, will appear in their hometown (place of birth) or place of residence.

## Glossary

Compounding
:    Compounding means the effect can be applied multiple times.

Recurring
:    Recurring means the effect is applied every Round.
