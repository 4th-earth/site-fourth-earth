# 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla

4th Earth [.rules as written](RAW): Vanilla is designed to provide a minimal setup for Players to create Characters and stories in the spirit of [4th Earth RAW](/).

If you want to expand these mechanics and aren't sure where to start, we RECOMMEND looking at the official add-on implementations known as Sprinkles.

The vanilla implementation is designed to facilitate solo-adventuring. However, the vanilla implementation MAY be used with groups, with or without a Narrator acting as facilitator and increasing story dynamism.

## Difficulty Rating

- The health Life Battery MUST NOT be used to reduce the Difficulty Rating.
- If using non-health Life Batteries:
    - Difficulty MAY be reduced by spending [Life Battery](#life-batteries) points; 1 Difficulty Rating for each target action battery point spent.
    - Difficulty Ratings SHOULD target one non-health battery; known as the target action battery. For example:
	    - Injury and healing Actions SHOULD affect the health battery.
	    - Physical Actions SHOULD predominately affect the physical battery.
	    - Mentally taxing Actions SHOULD predominately impact the mental battery.
	    - Magic and similar actions SHOULD predominately impact the spirit battery.
- Difficulty MAY be increased or decreased by negotiating with the Narrator, if applicable.

### Opposing Character Interactions

The following apply to Character Actions where the target of the Action is another Character who is contesting the Action; if the Action isn’t contested, the Difficulty Rating MUST be 0.

- There MUST be a Protagonist and an Antagonist; the Protagonist Player Rolls the Dice Pool.
- If the Antagonist is subdued, the Difficulty Rating MUST be 0.
    - The initial Difficulty Rating, unless subdued, SHOULD BE at least the number of Proficiency Ranks the Antagonist has in the same Action Types and Tools used by the Protagonist; including parent proficiencies.
- For physically aggressive Actions:
	- Difficulty Rating MUST represent difficulty to hit the Antagonist; this includes grappling, holding, or restraining the Antagonist.
	- Difficulty Rating SHOULD be calculated using the Antagonist Difficulty Rating below.
	- Damage SHOULD be calculated using the Protagonist Potential Energy below.
	- Grappling, holding, or restraining MUST NOT cause damage to the Antagonist.
			- If the Antagonist is restrained in some way, attempting to escape MUST result in the Antagonist becoming the Protagonist; SHOULD happen on the Antagonist’s turn, if using turn-based gameplay.
- The initial Difficulty Rating MAY be reduced by 1, if performing an Action using a specialty and having mastered the parent proficiency (three ranks).

#### Antagonist Difficulty Rating

The following describes a method for calculating the Difficulty Rating of an Antagonist.

- Start from the initial Difficulty Rating defined above.
- If the Antagonist is aware of the aggressive action, the Difficulty Rating MUST be increased by 1.

#### Protagonist Potential Energy

The following table describes a method for calculating the Potential Energy (damage) of an attack, which determines how many health battery points will be lost, if the attack is successful.

- Physical damage MUST target the health Life Battery.
- Verbal, advanced technology, or magic attacks MAY impact non-health Life Batteries and SHOULD be a known quality or attribute of the action, tool, or spell.
- Slow Actions MUST be limited to once per turn or round.
- Fast Actions MAY be performed twice by the protagonist in a Turn or Round.
	- If the Fast Action is performed twice, the Difficulty Rating MUST be divided by 2 and split evenly between the two Actions; if performing once, the Difficulty Rating MUST NOT be split.
		- If the Fast Action is performed twice and the Difficulty Rating is odd, Player MUST round up the first and round down the second Difficulty Rating.
		- If using non-health Life Batteries, Players MAY spend non-health Life Battery points to reduce the Difficulty Ratings individually; as if they were two, separate Actions.
- Potential Energy MAY be reduced mechanically (see Resistance Sprinkle), or, through negotiation and narrative convenience (incapacitate instead of kill, for example).

|Action                       |Details         |Potential Energy                                     |
|:---------------------------:|:--------------:|:----------------------------------------------------|
|Jab                          |Fast and light  |1 per Fast Action taken and successful; maximum of 2 |
|Uppercut, kick, ram, or slam |Slow and medium |2                                                    |
|Dual (tool each hand)        |Fast and medium |2 per Fast Action taken; maximum of 4                |
|Two-handed                   |Slow and medium |3                                                    |
|Advanced technology or magic |Slow and heavy  |5                                                    |


## Dice Pools

See Sprinkles.

## Proficiency Ranks

- Proficiency Points MUST be applied to a proficiency, specialty, or tool related to the Action performed. (For example, using a knife to cut bread results in a proficiency point being earned. That point can be applied to a cooking proficiency, to the edged tool, or both, however, the Proficiency Point MUST NOT be applied to a spell casting proficiency, if applicable.) We RECOMMEND:
	- 2 Proficiency Points earned on success,
	- 1 point earned on failure, and
	- 0 points earned for Actions with Difficulty Rating of 0; even if the initial Difficulty Rating was greater than 0.
- Proficiencies and specialties SHOULD be determined by Players as Characters interact with the Setting and other Characters; reduces pre-setup and starts game play in the most open and freeform condition.
	- Each proficiency MAY have up to 1 child proficiency. The parent SHOULD represent a general proficiency and the child SHOULD represent a specialty. The specialty AHOULD be a specific Action Type, not a combination. (For example, preparing food MAY have a child proficiency of baking a cake. Further, a master of unarmed combat MAY have a specialty in a jab but not in kung fu.)
	- Players MAY determine parent-child relationships among proficiencies and specialties.
	- The proficiency MUST be mastered before proficiency points are earned toward the specialty.
		- If a proficiency is later determined to be a specialty, we RECOMMEND moving the achieved points and ranks to the proficiency and re-building ranks in the specialty.
- Tools SHOULD NOT be tiered.

## Life Batteries

- Each battery MUST have 8 battery points.
- Each Character MUST have at least 1 battery named, health.
	- We RECOMMEND 3 additional non-health batteries named, physical, mental, and spirit.
- Characters are considered deceased (or incapacitated) when their health battery reaches 0.
	- If using non-health batteries, Characters are considered deceased (or incapacitated) when all Life Batteries are at 0.
- Characters may recharge their health battery by using items, resting, or transferring battery points as described below.
	- If using non-health batteries, any recharging Action SHOULD recharge all batteries, including health, at least 1 point per unit of time. We RECOMMEND the following recharging Actions and primary batteries affected per unit of time:
	   - Rest (slow): Health battery, 2 points.
	   - Nap (fast): Physical battery, 3 points.
	   - Sleep (fastest): Physical battery, 4 points.
	   - Meditate (fast): Mental battery, 3 points.
	   - Pray (fast): Spirit battery, 3 points.
	   - *Note: Slow, fast, and fastest speaks to the length of Character time compared to Player time required to recharge all batteries as if they were at, or near, 0.*
- Recharging activities MAY have a Difficulty Rating.
- Life Batteries MAY be used to recharge other batteries.
	- The health battery MUST NOT be used to recharge any other Life Batteries.
	- To recharge 1 Battery Point to a non-health battery, Players MUST spend Battery Points equal to the number of non-health battery minus 1 (the target). (For example, if there are 3 non-health Life Batteries, 2 points from spirit can be used to recharge 1 point to physical; or, 1 point from spirit and 1 point from mental can be used to recharge 1 point to physical.)
	- Battery Points equal to the number of non-health Life Batteries MUST be spent to recharge 1 point to the health battery. (For example, 3 non-health batteries means 2 points from spirit and 1 point from physical can be used to recharge 1 point to health.)
