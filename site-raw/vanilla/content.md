# 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla

Creating a [.tabletop role playing game](TTRPG) can be a bit overwhelming. 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla is designed to provide a minimal setup for Players to create Characters and begin creating stories in the spirit of [4th Earth RAW](/).

If you would like to expand these rules and mechanics and aren't sure where to start, we RECOMMEND looking at the official add-on implementations known as Sprinkles.

The vanilla implementation is designed to facilitate solo-adventuring and minimize the number of Players rolling at any given time. However, the vanilla implementation can also be used with groups, with or without a Narrator acting as facilitator and increasing story dynamism.

## Difficulty Rating

- Difficulty MAY be increased or decreased by negotiating with the Narrator, if applicable.
- If using a health Life Battery, spending battery points SHOULD NOT reduce the DifficultyRating.
- If using non-health Life Batteries (or a combination):
    - Difficulty MAY be reduced by spending non-health [Life Battery](#life-batteries) points; 1 Difficulty Rating for each target action battery point spent.
    - Difficulty Ratings SHOULD target one non-health battery; known as the target action battery. For example:
	    - Injury and healing actions SHOULD affect the health battery.
	    - Physical tasks SHOULD predominately affect the physical battery.
	    - Mentally taxing activities SHOULD predominately impact the mental battery.
	    - Magic and similar actions SHOULD predominately impact the spirit battery.

### Opposing Character Interactions

The following apply to Character Actions where the target of the Action is a Character who is contesting the Action; if the Action isn’t contested, the Difficulty Rating MUST be 0.

- There MUST be a protagonist and an antagonist where the protagonist is the Character performing the Action.
- The initial Difficulty Rating, unless subdued, SHOULD BE at least the number of Proficiency Ranks the antagonist has in the same proficiency being used by the protagonist; including parent proficiencies.
- For physically aggressive Actions:
	- Difficulty Rating MUST represent difficulty to hit the antagonist; this includes grappling, holding, or restraining the antagonist.
	- Difficulty Rating SHOULD be calculated using the Antagonist Difficulty Rating below.
	- Damage SHOULD be calculated using the Protagonist Potential Energy below.
	- Grappling, holding, or restraining MUST NOT cause damage to the Antagonist.
			- If the Antagonist is restrained in some way, attempting to escape MUST result in the Antagonist becoming the Protagonist; SHOULD happen on the Antagonist’s turn, if applicable.
- The initial Difficulty Rating MAY be reduced by 1, if performing an Action using a specialty proficiency and having mastered the parent proficiency’s (three ranks).

#### Antagonist Difficulty Rating

The following describes a method for calculating the Difficulty Rating of an Antagonist.

- Start from the initial Difficulty Rating defined above.
- If the Antagonist is aware of the aggressive action, the Difficulty Rating MUST be increased by 1.
- If the Antagonist has active allies, the Difficulty Rating SHOULD be increased by 1 for every 2 active allies. (1 active ally SHOULD NOT result in an increase, 4 active allies SHOULD result in an increase of 2.)

#### Protagonist Potential Energy

The following table describes a method for calculating the Potential Energy (damage) of an attack, which determines how many Life Battery points will be lost if the attack is successful.

- If using a health Life Battery, physical damage MUST target the health battery.
- Verbal, advanced technology, or magic attacks MAY impact non-health Life Batteries and SHOULD be a known quality or attribute of the action, technology, or spell.
- Slow Actions MUST be limited to once per turn or round.
- Fast Actions MAY be performed twice by the Attacking Character in a turn or round.
	- If the Fast Action is performed twice, the Difficulty Rating MUST be divided by 2 and split evenly between the two Actions; if performing once, the Difficulty Rating MUST NOT be split.
		- If the Fast Action is performed twice and the Difficulty Rating is odd, Player MUST round up the first and round down the second.
		- If using non-health Life Batteries, Players MAY spend non-health Life Battery points to reduce the Difficulty Ratings individually; as if they were two, separate actions.
- Potential Energy MAY be reduced mechanically (see Resistance Sprinkle), or, through negotiation and narrative convenience (incapacitate instead of kill, for example).

|Action |Details |Potential Energy |
|:——|:-——|:—————:|
|Jab    |Fast and light |1 per Fast Action taken and successful; maximum of 2 |
|Uppercut, kick, or ram |Slow and medium |2 |
|Dual (tool each hand) |Fast and medium |2 per Fast Action taken; maximum of 4 |
|Two-handed |Slow and medium |3 |
|Advanced technology or magic |Slow and heavy |5 |

## Dice Pools

See Sprinkles.

## Proficiency Ranks

- Proficiency Points MUST be applied to an Action Type or tool related to the action performed. (For example, using a knife to cut bread results in a proficiency point being earned. That point can be applied to a cooking Action Type, to the edged tool, or both, however, the Proficiency Point MUST NOT be applied to a spell casting Action Type, if applicable.) We RECOMMEND:
	- 2 Proficiency Points earned on success and
	- 1 point earned on failure.
- Skill-trees SHOULD be determined by Players as Characters interact with the Setting and other Characters; reduces pre-setup and starts game play in the most open and freeform condition.
	- Each proficiency MAY have up to 1 child proficiency. The parent SHOULD represent a general proficiency and the child SHOULD represent a specialty. (For example, preparing food MAY have a child proficiency of baking a cake.)
	- Players MAY determine parent-child relationships among proficiencies.
	- At least two ranks in the parent MUST be earned before proficiency points are earned toward the child (more specialized skill).
		- If a parent skill is created after proficiency points or ranks in the child have been earned, we RECOMMEND moving the achieved points and ranks to the parent proficiency and re-building ranks in the child.
- Tools SHOULD NOT be tiered.













## Life Batteries

- Each battery MUST have 8 battery points.
- Each Character MUST have at least 1 battery named, health.
	- We RECOMMEND 3 additional non-health batteries named, physical, mental, and spirit.
- Characters are considered deceased when their health battery reaches 0.
	- If using non-health batteries, Characters are considered deceased when all Life Batteries are at 0.
- Characters may recharge their health battery by using items, resting, or seeking assistance from other Characters.
	- If using non-health batteries, any recharging action SHOULD recharge all batteries, including health, at least 1 point per unit of time. We RECOMMEND the recharging Actions and primary batteries affected per unit of time:
	   - Rest (slow): Health battery, 2 points.
	   - Nap (fast): Physical battery, 3 points.
	   - Sleep (fastest): Physical battery, 4 points.
	   - Meditate (fast): Mental battery, 3 points.
	   - Pray (fast): Spirit battery, 3 points.
	   - *Note: Slow, fast, and fastest speaks to the length of player time compared to character time required to recharge all batteries as if they were at, or near, 0.*
- Recharging activities MAY have a Difficulty Rating applied.
- Batteries MAY be used to recharge other batteries.
	- Health MUST NOT be used to recharge any other Life Batteries.
	- 2 Battery Points from any combination of Life Batteries MUST be spent to recharge 1 point to the other, non-health, Life Battery. (For example, 2 points from spirit can be used to recharge 1 point to physical; or, 1 point from spirit and 1 point from mental can be used to recharge 1 point to physical.)
	- Battery Points equal to the number of non-health Life Batteries MUST be spent to recharge 1 point to the health battery. (For example, 3 non-health batteries means 2 points from spirit and 1 point from physical can be used to recharge 1 point to health.)

### Life Batteries: Official Additions

<details>
<summary>Assisting other Characters</summary>

When assisting other Characters using this modification, one Character transfers one or more of their battery points to the Character performing a given action. The Difficulty Rating here is applied to the action of assisting itself for the assisting character.

- The transfer MUST be from the same battery the point will be transferred to.
- Players MAY transfer battery points from a Character they control to another Character in the Setting; the baseline Difficulty Rating is based on distance between Characters:
	- Touch: Difficulty 0.
	- Distance (usually line of sight): Difficulty 1.
	- Ranged (MAY be out of sight): Difficulty 2.
- Players MAY increase the Difficulty Rating after starting with the baseline.
- The Difficulty Rating to assist SHOULD be less than the initial Difficult Rating of the action being performed by the other Character.
- Assisting SHOULD NOT require movement by the assisting character.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Death, resurrection, and reincarnation</summary>

- If a Character dies, 1 proficiency point SHOULD be removed from all completed Proficiency Ranks. This represents relearning or recovering skills, however, maintaining some memory of the skill.
- If a Character is resurrected, the health battery MUST be set to 1; all other batteries MUST be set to 0.
	- The Character is the same character and MAY retain possessions.
	- *Note: The Character has to have died first, therefore, the impact of death applies.*
- If a Character is reincarnated they are considered to have died and been resurrected, therefore, the impacts of those two situations apply along with:
	- 1 point being removed from all partially acquired Proficiency Ranks.
	- The Character loses all physical possessions they had at the time of death.
	- The Character, if maintained as the actual same Character, will appear in their hometown (place of birth) or place of residence.
