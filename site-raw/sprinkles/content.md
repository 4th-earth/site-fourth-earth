# 4th Earth RAW: Sprinkles

4th Earth RAW: Sprinkles are individual mechanics that MAY be sprinkled on top of 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla or your own 4th Earth RAW variation.

For the sake of keeping 4th Earth RAW: Vanilla relatively lightweight, they were pulled from that specification.

*Note: Sprinkles add complexity to gameplay.*

## Allies

- An active ally MUST be a Character who has the ability to perform Actions during a round and those Actions will be in support of the Protagonist or Antagonist, not both.
- If the Antagonist has active allies, the Difficulty Rating MUST be increased by 1 for every 2 active allies. (1 active ally MUST NOT result in an increase, 4 active allies SHOULD result in an increase of 2.)
    - If the Protagonist has active allies, the Difficulty Rating MAY be reduced in the same way as it is increased for the antagonist. (Both have 2 active allies, Difficulty Rating MAY NOT change.)

## Resistance

Resistance results in a modification to protagonist Potential Energy (PE) when attacked in a way that causes physical damage; draining the health Life Battery.

Every Character SHOULD have some type of flesh with varying degrees of thickness.

|Thickness |Resistance |PE adjustment |
|:---------|:---------:|:-------------|
|Thin      |negative 1 |plus 1        |
|Average   |0          |0             |
|Thick     |1          |minus 1       |

Characters MAY have some type of armor.

|Grade  |Resistance |PE adjustment |
|:------|:---------:|:-------------|
|None   |0          |0             |
|Light  |1          |minus 1       |
|Medium |2          |minus 2       |
|Heavy  |3          |minus 3       |

Players MAY apply different modifications for specific areas of the Character.

## Scale

Scale is a way of measuring the size difference between Characters in a Setting or Scene.

- The smallest Character in a Setting or interaction SHOULD be given a Scale of 1; the Scale of other Characters is relative to 1 in whole number increments.
    - When characters are interacting, the smallest Character in the interaction SHOULD be given a Scale of 1.
    - If the interacting Characters are roughly the same size, both SHOULD be Scale 1.

### Antagonist Difficulty Rating: Scale

Imagine a human trying to hit a fly. The human is hundreds of times larger than the fly. The fly is very difficult to hit without tools and being sneaky.

- If Antagonist is lesser Scale, the Difficulty Rating SHOULD be increased by 1 for each step smaller.

### Resistance: Scale

Presumes Resistance Sprinkle or similar implementation.

Imagine a fly hitting a human. The human is hundreds of times larger than the fly. The human most likely will never take damage enough to matter, even if bit.

- We RECOMMEND using in conjunction with the Resistance Sprinkle.
- Larger Scale Characters SHOULD have a higher Resistance, if applicable. We RECOMMEND increasing Resistance by 1 for each step greater the antagonist is.

## Stance

Stance affords Characters to be more or less aggressive, at a cost.

- Characters MUST be neutral in stance unless announced otherwise.
    - Players MAY decide whether the announcement should be with every Character Action, only if the stance changes, or, in some other way.
- Changing stance is considered a Fast Action.

### Antagonist Difficulty Rating: Stance

- Difficulty Raring adjustments SHOULD take the stance of the protagonist and antagonist into consideration.
- If the protagonist and antagonist are in neutral stance, there MUST NOT be an adjustment to the antagonist Difficulty Rating.
    - If the protagonist is in an offensive stance and the antagonist is in a defensive stance, there MUST NOT be an adjustment.
    - If the protagonist is in a defensive stance and the antagonist is in an offensive stance, there MUST NOT be an adjustment.
- If the protagonist and antagonist are both in an offensive stance, the antagonist Difficulty Rating SHOULD be decreased by 2.
    - If the protagonist and antagonist are both in a defensive stance, the antagonist Difficulty Rating SHOULD be increased by 2.
- If the protagonist is in an offensive stance and the antagonist is in a neutral position, the antagonist Difficulty Rating SHOULD be decreased by 1.
    - If the protagonist is in a defensive stance and the antagonist is in a neutral stance, the antagonist Difficulty Raring SHOULD be increased by 1.

|             |P: Offensive |P: Neutral |P: Defensive |
|-————--------|:—---—-----——|:-———------|:—------———--|
|A: Offensive |Minus 2      |Minus 1    | 0           |
|A: Neutral   |Minus 1      | 0         |Plus 1       |
|A: Defensive |0            |Plus 1     |Plus 2       |

## Re-roll

- Players MAY spend Proficiency Points and non-health Life Battery points to re-roll an action.
    - When using non-health Life Battery points, the points SHOULD use the target action battery. (Any inter-battery recharging mechanics SHOULD apply.)
- Players MAY spend 1 point to re-roll the whole Dice Pool or 2 points to re-roll a single die in the pool.
- As long as the Character has points remaining, the Player MAY continue spending points to re-roll.

## Advanced Technology and Magic

The following mechanics MAY be applied to both advanced technology tools and magic. 

- The use of advanced technology tools and magic MUST use two rolls and dice pools.
	- The first Difficulty Rating MUST represent the difficulty of using the advanced technology or casting a spell.
	- The second Difficulty Rating SHOULD use the Antagonist Difficulty Rating mechanic.
- If the Difficulty Rating of using the tools or casting the spell exceeds 7, the Difficulty Rating SHOULD be set at 7.
- Difficulty Rating to use MUST start at 0 and SHOULD be adjusted using the tables below.
	- Initial Difficulty Rating SHOULD be greater than 0 and MUST NOT be less than 0.
	- The tables SHOULD be used in whole, however, all tables MAY NOT be used.
		- The tables used SHOULD remain consistent for an entire session.

### Rarity of Tool or Spell

|Rarity |Modification |
|:-----|:------:|
|Ubiquitous |0 |
|Common |Plus 1 |
|Uncommon |Plus 2 |
|Rare |Plus 3 |

### Target of Tool or Spell

|Target |Modification |
|:------|:---------:|
|Inanimate object |Plus 1 |
|Self |Plus 2 |
|Another |Plus 3 |

### Intent of Protagonist

|Intent |Modification |
|:----|:---:|
|Survival |0 |
|Heal |Plus 1 |
|Harm |Plus 2 |

### Distance from Protagonist 

|Distance |Modification |
|:----|:---:|
|Touch |0 |
|Distance |1 |
|Ranged |2 |

### Internal or External to Target

Some advanced technology or magic MAY move from the Protagonist to the target
















## Criticality

Criticality represents success *and* failure beyond the intention of the Character for mundane and combat actions.

- Characters MUST have one or more non-health Life Batteries.
- Players MUST add an extra die to the Dice Pool, which is known as the Criticality Die and SHOULD be distinct from other dice in the pool; we RECOMMEND a 10-sided die, which represents a 10 percent chance of criticality.
	- The die MAY be changed per session or action.
- If a 1 is rolled on the Criticality Die, the result is a critical success or failure based on the success or failure of the rest of the Dice Pool, respectively.
- Players MAY decide to opt-out or -in to using the Criticality Die prior to the creation of the Dice Pool.
	- Players SHOULD decide whether they will apply the Critically Die prior to becoming aware of the Difficulty Rating assigned to the action.
	- Players MAY decide to always roll a Criticality Die as a group decision. We RECOMMEND the decision be made prior to the beginning of the session.

Beyond the narrative implications and outcomes, Criticality comes with mechanical impacts on the Character.

### Critical, mundane success

A critical success on a non-combat (mundane) action, results in the following changes to the battery targeted by the action.

- MUST NOT be the health battery.

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value    |Affect on Action target battery |
|:————|:——|
|Even number  |Plus 1 |
|1, 5, or 9      |Plus 2 |
|3 or 7         |Plus 3 |
|11           |Plus 5 |

If the Action target battery becomes full, the Player MAY distribute the remaining points to other non-health batteries of their choosing.

### Critical, mundane failure

Critical, mundane failure is the opposite of a Critical, mundane success.

- MUST subtract the affect in the Critical, mundane success table.
- If the Action target battery reaches 0, the Player MUST spend the remaining points against other non-health batteries of their choosing.
	- If using the Overflow recharging modification, Players SHOULD NOT use that mechanic to resolve the reduction of an Action target battery that’s reached 0 due to critical failure.

### Critical, combat success

This implementation presumes you are using the vanilla implementation of combat described above.

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value    |Effect |
|:————|:——|
|Even number |Plus 1 to attacker Action target battery, or, any other non-health battery if the Action target battery is full |
|1, 5, or 9      |Multiply base Potential Energy by 1.5 |
|3 or 7         |Multiply base Potential Energy by 2 |
|11           |Trauma: Roll another 12-sided die and apply result from the Critical, combat success effects extension table |

#### Critical, combat success effects extension table

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value    |Effect |
|:————|:——|
|1        |Defender Difficulty Rating reduced by 2, recurring and compounding |
|2, 5, or 8  |Multiply base Potential Energy by 2, target defender. |
|3, 6, or 9  |Multiply base Potential Energy by 2.5, target defender. |
|4 or 7     |Reduce defender’s spirit battery by 1; use health battery if spirit battery is unavailable or at 0 |
|10       |Reduce defender’s health battery by 1, recurring and compounding |
|11       |Multiply base Potential Energy by 3, target defender. |
|12       |Defender can’t act for 2 rounds |

Recurring means the effect is applied every round. Compounding means the effect can be applied multiple times. This simulates severe injury and allows for severe injury to occur multiple times.

For example, a Character (attacker) is fighting another Character (defender) with a Difficulty Rating of 6. The Player rolls a Critical, combat success that results in the Difficulty Rating being reduced by 2, becoming a Difficulty Rating of 4. Every following round, the defender’s Difficulty rating will be 4 (recurring). If the Player manages to roll the same Critical, combat success a second time, the defender’s Difficulty Rating becomes 2 for each following round (compounding). This could increase to the point where the defender’s Difficulty Rating becomes 0.

### Critical, combat failure

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value    |Effect |
|:————|:——|
|Even number |Minus 1 from attacker Action target battery, or, any other non-health battery, if the Action target battery is at 0 |
|1, 5, or 9      |Minus 2 from attacker Action target battery, does not impact other Life Batteries, if Action target battery is at 0 |
|3 or 7         |Attacker damages self at one-to-one Scale, 0 resistance, base Potential Energy divided by 2 (round down); damage cannot be less than 1 |
|11           |Trauma: Roll another 12-sided die and apply result from the Critical, combat failure effects extension table |

#### Critical, combat failure effects extension table

The Player rolls one, 12-sided die.

|Die value    |Effect |
|:————|:——|
|11        |Tool used is rendered useless for future rounds. If no tool is used, multiply base Potential Energy by 3 and target the attacker. |
|Other    |Apply Critical, combat success effects extension table replacing the word “defender” with “attacker” |

## Partials and Complications

This modification is designed to operate with the Criticality modification above, however, players MAY choose to use it as a standalone modification.

- Players MUST add an extra die to the Dice Pool, which is known as the Criticality die and SHOULD be distinct from the other dice in the pool; we RECOMMEND a 10-sided die, which represents a 10 percent chance of a partial or complication.
	- The die MAY be changed per session or per action.
- If the greatest number on the Criticality Die is rolled, the result is a partial or complication based on the success or failure of the rest of the Dice Pool.
	- A partial is a mildly positive effect on an otherwise failed action.
	- A complication is a mildly negative effect on an otherwise successful action.
- Players MAY decide to opt-out or -in to using the Criticality Die prior to the creation of the Dice Pool; Players SHOULD decide prior to becoming aware of the difficulty level assigned to the action.
	- Players MAY decide to always roll a Criticality Die as a group decision. We RECOMMEND the decision be made prior to the beginning of the session.

## Assisting other Characters

When assisting other Characters using this modification, one Character transfers one or more of their battery points to the Character performing a given action. The Difficulty Rating here is applied to the action of assisting itself for the assisting character.

- The transfer MUST be from the same battery the point will be transferred to.
- Players MAY transfer battery points from a Character they control to another Character in the Setting; the baseline Difficulty Rating is based on distance between Characters:
	- Touch: Difficulty 0.
	- Distance (usually line of sight): Difficulty 1.
	- Ranged (MAY be out of sight): Difficulty 2.
- Players MAY increase the Difficulty Rating after starting with the baseline.
- The Difficulty Rating to assist SHOULD be less than the initial Difficult Rating of the action being performed by the other Character.
- Assisting SHOULD NOT require movement by the assisting character.

## Death, resurrection, and reincarnation

- If a Character dies, 1 proficiency point SHOULD be removed from all completed Proficiency Ranks. This represents relearning or recovering skills, however, maintaining some memory of the skill.
- If a Character is resurrected, the health battery MUST be set to 1; all other batteries MUST be set to 0.
	- The Character is the same character and MAY retain possessions.
	- *Note: The Character has to have died first, therefore, the impact of death applies.*
- If a Character is reincarnated they are considered to have died and been resurrected, therefore, the impacts of those two situations apply along with:
	- 1 point being removed from all partially acquired Proficiency Ranks.
	- The Character loses all physical possessions they had at the time of death.
	- The Character, if maintained as the actual same Character, will appear in their hometown (place of birth) or place of residence.
