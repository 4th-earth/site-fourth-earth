# 4th Earth: Rules as Written

These are the guidelines and guardrails for 4th Earth [.rules as written](RAW) a framework for creating [.table-top role playing games](TTRPGs). The [Vanilla Implementation](/vanilla/) illustrates one method for applying the rules as written to create a TTRPG.

4th Earth RAW uses the key words described in [Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119), the all-caps are not screaming at you:

- MUST, REQUIRED, or SHALL, mean that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification;
- MUST NOT or SHALL NOT, mean that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification;
- SHOULD or RECOMMENDED, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course;
- SHOULD NOT or NOT RECOMMENDED, mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label; and
- MAY or OPTIONAL, mean that an item is truly optional.

4th Earth RAW is designed for collaborative storytelling, home brewing, and hacking. From the mundane, theatre of the absurd, to the fanciful and super-heroic, whether you're solo-adventuring or in a group, 4th Earth RAW gives you a set of mechanics to keep the mystery and challenge alive.

Players personify one or more [Characters](#characters) who interact with the [Setting](#setting) and other Characters.

**Equipment:** We RECOMMEND Players use standard polyhedral dice, however, any means by which choosing multiple random numbers between 1 and 12 will do; the dice would be:

- 4-sided,
- 6-sided,
- 8-sided,
- 10-sided, and
- 12-sided.

4th Earth RAW is created with the following values in mind:

- **Additive over reductive.** Players should be able to start from a simple foundation and add to it, instead of starting from a position of "everything and the kitchen sink" and reducing.
- **Narrative over simulation.** Players should be able to focus on creating engaging stories without strictly replicating reality.
- **Flow over grinding.** Players should be able to get lost in their story and actions without performing repetitive tasks.
- **Power ceilings over threat escalation.** Saved the town, saved the country, saved the world, saved the universe, what next? Having 50 percent of a Character's life force drained in one shot is the same whether their life force is 10 or 100.
- **Progressive disclosure over saturation.** Players should be able to enter a story having never read the rules or specification and learn as they go.

## Difficulty Rating

The Difficulty Rating is the Action mechanic for [Characters](#characters) to interact with the [Setting](#setting) and other Characters.

Character Actions consist of the following, minimal, list of activities:

1. Character intent; the Player describes what the Character will attempt to do.
2. The intent MUST be assigned an initial Difficulty Rating between 0 and Infinite.
3. The initial Difficulty Rating MAY be adjusted up or down.
4. The Player MAY create a [Dice Pool](#dice-pools) based on the adjusted Difficulty Rating and rolls to determine success or failure.

Actions are resolved by answering: Was the action successful? and How was the outside world affected by the action?

- Difficulty 0 MUST represent automatic success.
- Difficulty Infinite MUST be impossible for the Character to achieve in the Setting.
- Difficulty Ratings MUST NOT be less than 0.
- Difficulty Ratings SHOULD be based on the Character attempting the interaction, the complexity of the action, and qualities of any opposing force (standing up may be Difficulty 6 for an infant and Difficulty 0 for an adult).
- Players SHOULD be able to influence the Difficulty Rating in one or more ways.

### Difficulty Rating Table

|Level   |Sides            |Human-friendly             |Opposing value |
|:-----:|:-----------:|:----------------------|:------------:|
|0        |0                |Done!                        |Infinite          |
|1        |2                |Safe bet                     |7                 |
|2        |4                |Simple                        |6                |
|3        |6                |Difficult                      |5                |
|4        |8                |Long shot                    |4                |
|5        |10               |Leap of faith                |3                |
|6        |12               |Inconceivable                |2                |
|7        |No dice!        |Impossible, if not reduced |1                |
|Infinite |non-applicable |Impossible                    |0                |

*Note: Multiplying the Difficulty Rating by 2 results in the number sides for the dice in the [Dice Pool](#dice-pools).*

## Dice pools

Dice Pools are a collection of dice. 

- The number of sides of dice in the pool MUST be determined by the adjusted [Difficulty Rating](#difficulty-rating) in the [Difficulty Rating table](#difficulty-rating-table).
- The number of dice in the pool MUST NOT exceed the number of [Proficiency Ranks](#proficiency-ranks) applied to the Action.
- Dice Pools MUST have at least 1 die regardless of Difficulty Rating or Proficiency Ranks; referred to as the base die.
- Rolling 1 on a single die in the Dice Pool MUST represent successful completion of the action.
- Dice Pools SHOULD NOT exceed 5 dice, which keeps the pool manageable and allows room for additional dice to facilitate things like critical success, failure, or both.

## Proficiency Ranks

Proficiency Ranks represent the level of proficiency a [Character](#characters) has performing certain types of actions or using a tool. Proficiency Points are sub-aspects of a Proficiency Rank.

- Each rank SHOULD require earning two or more Proficiency Points toward the rank. 
- Each rank SHOULD be achievable in roughly four attempts.
- The implementation SHOULD be stable for the entire session. 
	- The implementation MAY be adjusted from session to session. 
	- These adjustments SHOULD be minimal from one session to the next.
- Action Types SHOULD have more possible ranks than tools. We RECOMMEND:
	- 4 Proficiency Points per rank.
	- 3 ranks per Action Type.
	- 1 rank per tool; general, not specific (a knife is a knife, however, a knife used for cooking is different than a knife used for combatâ€“even if it's the exact same knife).
- Each rank MAY increase the number of dice in the [Dice Pool](#dice-pools) by 1.
- Using a tool MAY reduce the [Difficulty Rating](#difficulty-rating) of an Action up to 2 levels.

## Life Batteries

Life batteries represent the life force of a [Character](#characters). Battery Points are a sub-aspect of Life Batteries.

- Batteries MUST have multiple ways to recharge. 
	- Some recharging methods SHOULD be player initiated (sleep, for example).
	- The implementation SHOULD favor a "both ways" approach; if batteries can recharge multiple ways, they SHOULD be able to drain multiple ways (starvation, for example).
- The number of Batteries SHOULD be kept to a minimum to reduce administrative overhead and maintain tension.
- Batteries SHOULD have the same maximum number of Battery Points for each battery.
- Batteries SHOULD be the same for all Characters in a [Setting](#setting) with the same rules applied (even non-player Characters and enemies).
	- Batteries MAY be created before play begins, however, we RECOMMEND creating Life Batteries as the story progresses  based on the Actions of Characters. (Players may decide a stealth battery is appropriate while playing and add it to all Characters).
- Battery Points MAY be used to reduce [Difficulty Rating](#difficulty-rating).

## Characters

- MUST be part of one or more encompassing identities.
- MUST have one or more [Life Batteries](#life-batteries).
- SHOULD be played by the same Player with every appearance unless otherwise agreed to in the [Social Contract](#social-contract).
- SHOULD favor nurture over nature for [Proficiency Ranks](#proficiency-ranks).
- SHOULD have a unique name to distinguish Characters from one another.

Examples:

1. Teenage, male, human, cleric with a health battery with a maximum value of 10. Grew up in a monastery where he learned healing spells.
2. Adult, female, goddess, warrior with health, physical, mental, and aura batteries with a maximum value of 8 each. Grew up in a military family and has been training since she was old enough to walk.
3. Elderly, female, dog with a health battery with a maximum value of 6.

*Note: The Characters in these examples, MUST NOT be played in the same [Setting](#setting), unless the Players agree to modify the Characters to have the same Life Batteries and maximum values.*

## Setting

4th Earth RAW is a game engine and does not require a specific Setting. Further, you can use 4th Earth RAW in the Setting of other games.

- MUST be agreed to by *all* players (including the Narrator, if applicable).
- MUST be enough to give flavor and direction; MAY be a single sentence or tome.
- MUST describe where, when, what, and general theme.
- MAY be developed by the Players, a Narrator, the outside world, or anything else.
- MAY include a specific, short-term plot (adventures and one-shots). 
	- MAY be a generic, long-term campaign. 
	- MAY be a world open for exploration with no agenda or conflict beyond that exploration. 
	- Or, MAY be a combination.

Examples:

1. Jungle, 1955, Vietnam, hospital camp, filled with ordinary people, using technology appropriate to the time; mainly for healing (a serial war story).
2. Greek mythos, The Underworld during the 12th labor of Hercules involving deities and demigods (a one-shot mythology hero quest).
3. Early 21st century, Pluto, single-cell organisms (an evolution serial).

*Note: The last example includes a baseline description of the [Characters](#characters) that can be played during the serialized adventure.*

## Social Contract

The Social Contract, is an agreement or understanding between Players (including the Narrator, if applicable) about how they will behave towards each other. Much like character for the individual and culture for the group, a Social Contract will exist. The question is: How transparent, intentional, and formal is it?

Another way to look at it, the Social Contract is the guidelines and guardrails for meatspace. 

The Social Contract:

- MUST be agreed to by all Players.
- MUST be applied to all Players in a similar manner.
- MAY be verbal or unspoken; we RECOMMEND writing it down.
- MAY be created as Players interact with each other.
