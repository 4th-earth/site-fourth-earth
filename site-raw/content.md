# 4th Earth: Rules as Written

These are the guidelines and guardrails for 4th Earth [.rules as written](RAW) a framework for creating [.table-top role playing games](TTRPGs). The Vanilla Implementation illustrates one method for applying the rules as written to create a TTRPG.

4th Earth RAW uses the key words described in [Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119):

- MUST, REQUIRED, or SHALL;
- MUST NOT or SHALL NOT;
- SHOULD or RECOMMENDED;
- SHOULD NOT or NOT RECOMMENDED; and
- MAY or OPTIONAL.

4th Earth RAW is designed for collaborative storytelling (and home brewing) from the mundane, theatre of the absurd, to the fanciful and super-heroic. Whether you're solo-adventuring or in a group, 4th Earth RAW gives you a set of mechanics to keep the mystery and unknown alive.

Players personify one or more Characters who interact with the Setting and other Characters. Interactions:

- MUST be assigned a [Difficulty Rating](#difficulty-rating) and
- MAY target a non-health [Life Battery](#life-batteries), if applicable.

The Player for the Character MAY create a [Dice Pool](#dice-pools)based on the Difficulty Rating, where the number of dice in the pool MAY be less than or equal to the number of applicable [Proficiency Ranks](#proficiency-ranks) available to the Character.

We RECOMMEND Players use standard polyhedral dice; specifically:

- 4-sided,
- 6-sided,
- 8-sided,
- 10-sided, and
- 12-sided.

4th Earth RAW is created with following values in mind:

1. **Additive over reductive.** Players should be able to start from a simple foundation and add to it, instead of starting from an "everything and the kitchen sink" place and reducing.
2. **Narrative over simulation.** Players should be able to focus on creating engaging stories without strictly replicating reality.
3. **Flow over grinding.** Players should be able to get lost in their story and actions without performing repetitive tasks.
4. **Power ceilings over threat escalation.** Saved the town, saved the country, saved the world, saved the universe, what next?
5. **Progressive disclosure over saturation.** Players should be able to start having never read the rules or specification and learn as they go.

## Difficulty Rating

The Difficulty Rating is the Action mechanic for Characters to interact with the Setting and other Characters.

Character actions consist of the following, minimal, list of activities:

1. Character intent; the Player describes what the Character will attempt to do.
2. The intent is assigned an initial [Difficulty Rating](#difficulty-rating).
3. The initial Difficulty Rating MAY be adjusted up or down.
4. The Player MAY create a Dice Pool based on the agreed upon Difficulty Rating and rolls the Dice Pool.

Actions are resolved by answering:

- Was the action successful? and 
- How was the outside world affected by the action?

Difficulty Ratings are based on qualities of the opposing force or Character for the given Action and the Character performing that Action. 

- Difficulty 0 MUST represent automatic success.
- Difficulty Infinite MUST be impossible for the Character to achieve in the Setting.
- Difficulty Ratings MUST NOT be less than 0.
- Difficulty Ratings SHOULD be based on the Character attempting the interaction (standing up may be Difficulty 6 for an infant and Difficulty 0 for an adult).
- Players SHOULD be able to influence the Difficulty in one or more ways.

### Difficulty Rating Table

|Level   |Sides            |Human-friendly             |Opposing value |
|:-----:|:-----------:|:----------------------|:------------:|
|0        |0                |Done!                        |Infinite          |
|1        |2                |Safe bet                     |7                 |
|2        |4                |Simple                        |6                |
|3        |6                |Difficult                      |5                |

|6        |12               |Inconceivable                |2                |
|7        |No dice!        |Impossible, if not reduced |1                |
|Infinite |non-applicable |Impossible                    |0                |

## Dice pools

Dice Pools are a collection of dice. The sides of the dice in the pool is determined by the [Difficulty Rating](#difficulty-rating-table) of the Action. The number of dice in the pool is determined by the number of [Proficiency Ranks](#proficiency-ranks) applied to the Action.

- Dice Pools MUST have at least 1 die regardless of Difficulty Rating or Proficiency Ranks; referred to as the base die.
- Rolling 1 on a single die in the Dice Pool MUST represent successful completion of the action.
- Dice Pools SHOULD NOT exceed 5 dice, which keeps the pool manageable and allows room for additional dice to facilitate things like critical success, failure, or both.

## Proficiency Ranks

Proficiency Ranks represent the level of proficiency a Character has performing certain types of actions or using a tool.

- Each rank SHOULD require earning two or more Proficiency Points toward the rank. 
- Each rank SHOULD be achievable in roughly four attempts.
- The implementation used SHOULD be stable for the entire session. 
	- The implementation MAY be adjusted from session to session. 
	- These adjustments SHOULD be minimal from one session to the next.
- Action Types SHOULD have more possible ranks than tools. We RECOMMEND:
	- 3 ranks per Action Type.
	- 1 rank per tool; general, not specific (a knife is a knife).
	- 4 Proficiency Points per rank.
- Each rank MAY increase the number of dice in the Dice Pool by 1.
- Using a tool MAY reduce the Difficulty Rating of an action up to 2 levels.

## Life Batteries

Life batteries represent the life force of a Character. 

- Characters MUST have at least one Life Battery.
- Batteries MUST have multiple ways to recharge. 
	- Some recharging methods SHOULD be player initiated (sleep, for example).
	- SHOULD favor a "both ways" approach; if batteries can recharge multiple ways, they SHOULD be able to drain multiple ways (starvation, for example).
- The number of Batteries SHOULD be kept to a minimum to reduce administrative overhead and maintain tension.
- Batteries SHOULD have the same maximum number of battery points; for each battery.
- Batteries SHOULD be the same for all Characters (even non-player characters) in a Setting with the same rules applied.
- Batteries MAY be created before play begins or created as the story progresses (Players may decide a stealth battery is appropriate while playing).
- Batteries MAY be used to resolve actions.














## Characters

Characters are anything within a [Setting](#setting) that can be personified by a Player.

- MUST be part of one or more more general identities.
- MUST have one or more [Life Batteries](#life-batteries).
- SHOULD be played by the same Player with every appearance unless otherwise agreed to in the Player Pacts.
- SHOULD favor nurture over nature for Proficiencies.
- SHOULD have a unique name to distinguish characters form one another.

Examples:

1. Teenage, male, human, cleric with a health battery with a maximum value of 10. Grew up in a monastery where he learned healing spells.
2. Adult, female, goddess, warrior with health, physical, mental, and aura batteries with a maximum value of 8 each. Grew up in a military family and has been training since she was old enough to walk.
3. Elderly, female, dog with a health battery with a maximum value of 6.

## Setting

4th Earth RAW is a game engine and does not require a specific setting. Further, you can use 4th Earth RAW in the setting of other games.

- MUST be agreed to by *all* players (including the narrator).
- MUST be enough to give flavor and direction; could be a single sentence or tome.
- MUST describe where, when, what, and general theme.
- MAY be developed by the players, a narrator, the outside world, or anything else.
- MAY include a specific, short-term plot (adventures and one-shots). 
	- MAY be a generic, long-term campaign. MAY be a world open for exploration with not agenda beyond exploration. Or, a combination.

Examples:

1. Jungle, 1955, Vietnam, hospital camp, filled with ordinary people, using technology appropriate to the time; mainly for healing (a serial war story).
2. Greek mythos, The Underworld during the 12th labor of Hercules involving deities and demigods (a one-shot mythology hero quest).
3. Early 21st century, Pluto, single-cell organisms (an evolution serial).

The last example includes a baseline description of the characters that can be played during the serialized adventure.
